My name is Charles Anthony Alderete and I am a junior back end developer. I'm married to the love of my life Christina, and I have one daughter named Isabella.

I spent 17 years working in meat departments, five of them in managment. The first 15 years where spent with Publix supermarkets and the last 2 for Wholefoods. During my years with Publix I also attended the Atlanta Institute of Music, after graduating I tought guitar lessons for about 6 years.

I thouroghly enjoyed my time as a guitar teacher and also as a meat cutter and manager, but in both of those fields there is a ceiling and eventually it seems that all you are doing is going into work and executing the same plans, and solving the same problems again and again.....Not so with computers. The history of software is facinating, and computer languages and frameworks are everchanging, and this profesion speaks to my passion for both building things and solving problems. And so I decided to attend the Iron Yard Atlanta where I was trained to build apps using ruby on rails.
