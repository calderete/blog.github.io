###Duckbills

**About**

This was a hackathon project that was completed in 48 hours with 3 front end engineers and myself as the backend engineer. Our task was to create an application for spliting bills among roommates. First the person who's name is on the bill signs up as the "treasurer", next they can create rommates and assign them bills, rommates can then log in to view their bills. Version 2.0 will support in app messaging.

**Tools**

* Rails: This app was built using ruby on rails
* Heroku: It is deployed on a heroku server
* bcrypt: I used bcrypt to handle passwords

###5 Words

**About**

This was the final project I worked on and was the idea of one of our front end students. Once a user signs up they select 5 words that are their top lifstyle interests. They can then match with other users based on those interests. Users can also assign 5 words to other catagories and match with other users based on the words they pick. Once the user sees their matches they can add them as a friend at which point they can see their contact info, profile picture, and photos. The API I built for this app has the foundation for in app messaging and could easily be used for a dating app.

**Tools**

* Rails: This app was built using ruby on rails
* Heroku: It is deployed on a heroku server
* S3: It uses AWS S3 storage for photos
* Paperclip: I used thought bots paperclip gem to handle uploads
* bcrypt: I used bcrypt to handle passwords
