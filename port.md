###Duckbills

**About**

This was a hackathon project that was completed in 48 hours with 3 front end engineers and myself as the backend engineer. Our task was to create an application for spliting bills among roommates. First the person who's name is on the bill signs up as the "treasurer", next they can create rommates and assign them bills, rommates can then log in to view their bills. Version 2.0 will support in app messaging.

**Tools**

* Rails: This app was built using rails
* Heroku: It is deployed on a heroku server
* Sublime: I use sublime as my text editor
