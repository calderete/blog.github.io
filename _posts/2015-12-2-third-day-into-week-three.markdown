### Link to My old Blog
Since starting to make my portfolio last week I've decided to start using Jekyll for my posts.  If you would like to read about my earlier weeks learning to code you can click <a href="https://medium.com/@Charlie1980">here</a>.  I have some screen shots of old code and the problems I encountered with the weekend projects during the first weeks at the Iron Yard.

### Started Final Project
My team started our final project on monday. By noon I had sign-up, and log-in working and deployed as a heroku app.  Before I left for the day I also had create words up and running for the 2 man front end team to start making words. Yesterday (Tuesday) I got all the search and matching functionality working. If your curious I have the API <a href="https://github.com/5-Words/Back-end-five-words/tree/master/five_words">DOCS</a> here. Tomorrow if the front end has more of the functionality set up I will likely work through whatever issues they might have, if not I plan on getting either twillio or mandrill integration up, or at the very least get some tests written. Ive also been putting in quite a bit of work on portfolio (including this blog and learning how to use jekyll), here is my piktograph <a href="https://magic.piktochart.com/output/9640613-charlies-portfolio">link</a>.
