###Final projects week

So we are about to end our break and tear into our final projects. I did not pitch any of my ideas, not through lack of ambition but more from my desire to tackle someone elses problem and make a working back end that handles what they need. The app I will be working on has a working title of "5-words".  A user will starts out by selecting 5 interests in a "Golden" category. The user can than search for matches in that category based on the 5 words they put in as their interests. This presents a few challanges for me that I have not encountered.  For one the database design is not something I've encountered yet, I'm thinking it will require a 3 way join table, however there are other options and I will start to see which is the best way to go tomorrow.
